# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a professional web application showcasing 80s music data. The project uses modern TypeScript with strict type checking, ES6 modules, and professional development tooling.

**Architecture:**
- `index.html` - HTML structure with semantic elements and accessibility features
- `style.css` - Professional styling with responsive design and accessibility
- `src/script.ts` - Main TypeScript application logic with full type safety
- `src/song-data.ts` - Typed data module with interfaces
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration with strict mode
- `package.json` - Node.js project configuration with build scripts

## Type System

The project uses full TypeScript with strict type checking for maximum type safety:

- **Song interface**: TypeScript interface with `name` (string), `artist` (string), `year` (number 1980-1989)
- **Type checking**: Full TypeScript compilation with `strict: true` and comprehensive type validation
- **Union types**: SortColumn ('song' | 'artist' | 'year') and SortOrder ('asc' | 'desc' | 'none')
- **IDE integration**: Full TypeScript IntelliSense, error detection, refactoring, and autocomplete
- **Null safety**: Strict null checks prevent runtime errors

## Development Standards

The project follows strict coding standards defined in `.claude-rules`:

**Code Formatting**: All code must follow Prettier formatting standards for consistency:
- HTML: 2-space indentation, self-closing tags with `/`, multi-line attributes with `>` at end of last attribute line
- JavaScript: 2-space indentation, semicolons required, trailing commas, single quotes
- CSS: 2-space indentation, trailing semicolons, consistent spacing
- Line length: 80-100 characters maximum

**Branch naming**: `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/display-sample-data`)
**Commit format**: Conventional Commits with type matching branch type
**Variable declarations**: `const` preferred, `let` when reassigned, never `var`
**Comments**: JSDoc for public APIs and type definitions, single-line for local context only

## Key Files

- `src/script.ts` - Main TypeScript application with sorting logic and URL persistence
- `src/song-data.ts` - Typed data module with Song interface and sample data
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration with strict type checking
- `package.json` - Build scripts and development dependencies
- `.claude-rules:55-119` - Comprehensive TypeScript coding standards

## Development Workflow

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js 16+ installed
- TypeScript installed globally: `npm install -g typescript`

**Development Commands:**
- `npm run dev` - Start development server with live TypeScript compilation
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to production JavaScript
- `npm run build:watch` - Watch mode compilation for active development
- `npm run type-check` - Type checking without file emission
- `npm run serve` - Serve the application locally

**Professional Debugging:**
- **Source Maps**: Enabled for debugging TypeScript directly in browser DevTools
- **Type Checking**: Real-time error detection in VS Code with TypeScript language server
- **Browser DevTools**: Debug compiled JavaScript with source map support
- **Console Debugging**: Type-safe console.log with IntelliSense support

## Current Session Progress (August 31, 2025)

### ✅ COMPLETED: TypeScript Migration & Code Quality Phase
**Branch:** ts-code-refactor (active)

**Completed Tasks:**
1. ✅ Complete TypeScript migration from JavaScript
2. ✅ Implement strict type checking with enhanced tsconfig.json
3. ✅ Separate data from code using JSON import pattern
4. ✅ Add comprehensive cleanup (gitignore, prebuild scripts, documentation)
5. ✅ Successfully merge TypeScript migration into main branch
6. ✅ Push all changes to remote repository
7. ✅ Create new branch `ts-code-refactor` for deep code review

### ✅ COMPLETED: Professional Documentation Standards & TypeScript Migration
**Branch:** ts-refactoring-commenting-style (completed and ready for merge)

**Completed Improvements:**
- [x] **Professional Commenting Standards** - Established comprehensive TSDoc guidelines in `.claude-rules` using `src/song-data.ts` as exemplar:
  - Module-level documentation starts with action verbs describing what modules DO
  - Use proper TSDoc tags: `@remarks` for design decisions, `@see` for cross-references, `@beta` for future considerations
  - Property comments placed BEFORE properties with inline examples using `@example` tag
  - Comments explain WHY and design decisions, NEVER describe WHAT the code does
  - Include concrete examples with actual values and TypeScript error messages
  - One example per comment for brevity and clarity
  - Document business constraints that TypeScript cannot enforce at compile time

- [x] **song-data.ts Professional Refactoring** - Complete documentation overhaul serving as project exemplar:
  - Module documentation starts with "Reads songs.json and exports..."
  - Explained architectural decisions (interface vs type vs class trade-offs)
  - Documented future considerations with @beta tag (runtime validation without external dependencies)
  - Added concrete TypeScript error examples for compile-time validation
  - Professional property documentation with inline @example tags
  - Strongly-typed array documentation explaining TypeScript validation vs business rules

- [x] **Documentation Standards Applied** - Updated all project documentation:
  - Updated `.claude-rules` with comprehensive TSDoc guidelines based on song-data.ts
  - Updated README.md with latest documentation standards and TSDoc practices
  - Updated CLAUDE.md with completed work and professional commenting standards

**Project Status:** Full TypeScript migration complete with professional documentation standards established

## Next Task: script.ts Refactoring

**Priority:** Apply established commenting standards to `src/script.ts`

**Objectives:**
- Review and refactor all comments in src/script.ts following the song-data.ts exemplar
- Apply professional TSDoc standards established in .claude-rules
- Ensure comments explain WHY and design decisions, not WHAT the code does
- Add proper TSDoc documentation for complex functions and business logic
- Document architectural decisions and constraints TypeScript cannot enforce
- Remove any redundant comments that describe obvious code functionality

**Branch:** script-ts-refactor (to be created after merge and push)

## Future Enhancement Recommendations

### 1. Code Quality & Tooling
**Priority: High** - Essential for maintaining professional standards

- **Add ESLint** for TypeScript linting
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint
  ```
  Benefits: Catch potential bugs, enforce coding standards, improve consistency

- **Add Prettier** for automatic code formatting
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev prettier
  ```
  Benefits: Consistent formatting, no style debates, saves time

- **Consider adding Husky** for pre-commit hooks
  Benefits: Ensure code quality before commits, run tests automatically

### 2. TypeScript Configuration Enhancements
**Priority: Medium** - Improves type safety further

- **Add `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true`** in tsconfig.json
  Makes array/object access safer by assuming values could be undefined
  
- **Skip `"declaration": true`** (not needed for standalone apps)
  Only needed if building a library for others to consume

### 3. Development Experience
**Priority: Medium** - Better developer workflow

- **Consider Vite** instead of basic serve
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev vite
  ```
  Benefits: Hot Module Replacement (HMR), faster builds, better dev experience

- **Add npm scripts** for common tasks:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*.ts",
    "format": "prettier --write src/**/*.ts"
  }
  ```

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
**Priority: High** - Critical for production applications

- **Add Vitest or Jest** for unit testing
  ```bash
  npm install --save-dev vitest @vitest/ui
  ```
  Benefits: Catch bugs early, refactor with confidence, document behavior

- **Add Playwright or Cypress** for E2E testing
  Benefits: Test full user workflows, catch integration issues

### 5. Build Optimization
**Priority: Low** - Only needed for production deployment

- **Add minification** with a bundler (Vite/Rollup/esbuild)
- **Consider code splitting** if the app grows larger
- **Add production build script** with optimizations

### 6. Documentation
**Priority: Low** - Nice to have for team projects

- **Add JSDoc comments** to exported functions
- **Consider TypeDoc** for API documentation generation
- **Add CONTRIBUTING.md** if open-sourcing

### 7. Project Cleanup
**Priority: High** - Immediate action recommended

- **Remove jsconfig.json** if it still exists (redundant with tsconfig.json)
- **Add .env support** if you need environment variables
- **Consider adding a LICENSE file**

### 8. Package Manager Migration
**Priority: Low** - Consider for future optimization

- **Migrate to pnpm** for better performance and disk space efficiency
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  pnpm import  # Converts package-lock.json to pnpm-lock.yaml
  rm package-lock.json
  ```
  Benefits: Faster installs, smaller node_modules, stricter dependency resolution
  
- **Alternative: Consider Bun** for all-in-one runtime and package manager
  Benefits: Ultra-fast performance, built-in TypeScript support, bundler included
  
- **Evaluate based on project needs** - npm is fine for small projects

## Current Professional Score: 8.5/10

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Clean TypeScript migration with strict typing
- ✅ Excellent accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Good project structure
- ✅ URL persistence and professional UX
- ✅ Source maps for debugging
- ✅ ES6 modules (modern standard)

**Areas for Improvement:**
- ⚠️ No linting/formatting tools
- ⚠️ No test coverage
- ⚠️ Basic dev server (no HMR)
- ⚠️ No CI/CD pipeline

## Quick Start Improvements

To quickly elevate to professional standards, run:
```bash
# Essential tooling
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint prettier

# Create config files
echo '{"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"]}' > .eslintrc.json
echo '{"semi": true, "singleQuote": true}' > .prettierrc.json

# Add to package.json scripts
npm pkg set scripts.lint="eslint src/**/*.ts"
npm pkg set scripts.format="prettier --write src/**/*.ts"
```
